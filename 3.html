  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)
    ,[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to
    the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-tim
    e compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
     prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
     Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of
     the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
      an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
      use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers
       have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
